# CubeImagesGenerator


Mattan, Open the builds folder. In it, theres a Unity .exe link "DanielModelBuilding." Sorry, I was sure your name is Daniel lol.
this will open the "game." to exit click escape on your keyboard.
to generate images click the "Generate Images" button. this will create an Images folder in the same file the unity .exe is in.
note: this is meant for windows.
